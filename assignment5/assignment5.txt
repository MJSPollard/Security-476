    Let P be the probability that Eve would succeed, then,
    P = 1 - (1 - 1/(2^20))^n

II)

    If P = 0.5, we have,
    0.5 = 1 - (1 - 1/(2^20))^n
    Therefore,
    n = ln(0.5/(1 - (1/(2^20))))
    or,
    n = 726817.15 (rounded)

III)

    Using the rand() functions in C or Java could potentially generate the same random number more than once.
    To avoid this issue and guarantee a success within 2^20 tries, you could do as follows.
        1. Create a list with every number from 0 to 2^20.
        2. Use the rand() function to select an index in the list and try to use the value at that index.
        3. If it fails, remove that value from the list and decrease the rand() range by 1.
        4. Repeat until the list size is 0 or the value was a success.

IV)

    With this method we have the following equation,
    Probability = (1 - m/(2^20))^m
    The smallest whole number m to get at least 50% probability is m = 853.
